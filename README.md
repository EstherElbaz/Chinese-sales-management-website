Chinese sales management website
This site was written for all the managers of associations and organizations, and in their honor.
The project is an accurate system for managing prize draws.
The system is complex and includes all the steps required to perform mass prize draws;
Starting with an administrator, who defines gifts, prices, donors, a user interface where the gifts and prices are displayed, and where the purchase process is conducted.
Of course, the system includes functionality to perform the lottery itself.
To write the client code, I used Angular, keeping in mind the unique way of writing for the library.
What makes this project unique is the use of the Angular library "kendo" for the purpose of presenting the various data during the application in a pleasant and orderly manner. For example, the gift list is presented as a nicely organized and designed grid.

We will continue to write to you, good world.
